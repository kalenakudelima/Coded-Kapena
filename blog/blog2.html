  <h2>One Last Hana Hou at The Waikiki Shell</h2>
<p>The Waikiki Shell is one of the most iconic venues in Hawaii with a history of sold out performances from
artists like Bob Marley, Frank Sinatra and Hawaii’s own, C&K. On September 26, 2015, Revive The Live held
its first sold out show at that iconic venue, billed to be a place where fans can watch the stars under the stars.
The night started out sweet and slow with a performance by Tropical Knights. Following their feel good, island
music was a group made up of Kapena’s children—a band fittingly named Kapena Kids. The music continued
with performances from some of the Fathers and Pioneers of Island Reggae including The Mana’o Company,
Bruddah Waltah and Fiji.

<br><br>But the show was far from finished.

<br><br>In 1985, a group made up of two Tongan brothers and one haole boy from Kaimuki High School entered a high
school competition called Brown Bags To Stardom. Their love for music only grew from then and the trio soon
became one of the most sought after groups in the islands. This band, known as Kapena, celebrated 30 years of
electrifying music last summer. To commemorate their anniversary, the original members, who have not
performed together in over a decade, reunited for one last show in Hawaii. They were the headliners and
closing act for the second annual Revive The Live concert series. Fans came from all over the world to see the
original members of Kapena perform their magic together for the last time in Hawaii. With an opening
number featuring over 30 Polynesian dancers, unmistakable melodies, unmatched three-part harmonies and
classic music that so many loyal fans have grown to love, Kapena mesmerized a crowd of over 8500 people.

<br><br>Kapena ended the night with Danny’s Song, a song they are known to close with at The Waikiki Shell.
Thousands of lighters lit up a sea of people while Kapena sang their last song. It was a breathtaking farewell to
a group who created the soundtracks of our childhood. Revive The Live is proud to bring some of the best
concerts and performances to the people of Hawaii. And to think, this was just the second annual.</p>
